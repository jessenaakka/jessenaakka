ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jessenaakka. Iâ€™m interested in webdevelopment, beatiful design, UX-friendly applications and cryptocurrencies. 
Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js, React and React Native. If you have some questions hit me up from my LinkedInn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-naakka-024962168/

I will be creating projects and adding those to my GitHub. 

Ideas for the next projects:
Node.js: 
  - API for portfolio and BudgetPlanner
  
React:
  - Portfolio
  - OCW (OneCryptoWallet) desktop version
  
React Native:
  - OCW (MyCryptoWallet) app
  - BudgetPlanner
  
Description for projects:
  - I will create new portfolio using React. I will also redesign it to look better!
  - OneCryptoWallet will be a nice and simple crypto app using free crypto API's. Idea behind the app will be that I would have more clear way of seeing all of my crypto in one place.
  - BudgetPlanner will be a app for me and my girlfriend to use to plan our money usage. App will allow for you to add monthly recurring expenses, monthly incoms and other expenses. You can also add a plan on how much you want to save money in a month and the app will calculate daily useage that will be caculated on monthly costs and other expenses that are marked to the app.
